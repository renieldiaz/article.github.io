  <th>Japanese culture is rich and diverse. Japan is widely  known for their traditional
  arts and contemporary pop culture. In fact it is possible to see kimono-clad women 
  shuffling down the street with umbrellas overhead, or oversized sumo wrestlers 
  battling it out the ring. Japanese culture has become attractive and even fashionable 
  to many foreigners mainly because of their sophisticated cuisine, unique social
  customs, and refined performing, and visual arts. </th>

  <td>Avid eaters can indulge their palates in Japan, where the most luxurious dining 
  experience is the kaiseki meal that consists of a series of dishes. The ingredients 
  and presentations depend on the season. Also traditional, but far less fancy, are bento 
  boxes, a lunch option that includes a combination of rice, pickles, fish or meat and 
  vegetables. Daring foodies will want to try blowfish, known locally as fugu. Choose 
  a government-licensed chef, since eating fugu that has been incorrectly prepared can 
  be fatal.</td>

   <td>Of Japan's castles, the most arresting is the 17th century 
   Himeji Castle, known for its white walls. Matsumoto Castle 
   has Japan's oldest keep. On the island of Okinawa, visit
   Shuri Castle Park, which harbors ruins from the Ryukyuan
   culture that inhabited the region from the 12th to the 17th century. In Hiroshima 
   stands the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, the only building that
   remained standing after the atomic bomb explosion in August 1945.<br><br>Religious sites
   are among Japan's top draws. Kyoto, the capital from the late-8th to the mid-19th 
   century, has several famous Buddhist temples, including the Kiyomizu Temple 
   and Sanjusangendo Hall. The latter is known for its 1,001 
   statues of the goddess Kannon. In Tokyo, the modern capital, there is the Sensoji 
   Temple, constructed in the 7th century to house a statue of the Kannon
   said to have been caught in the Sumida River. Japan's most lavish Shinto shrine is 
   the 17th-century Toshogu Shrine in Nikko, which is adorned with gold 
   leaf.</td>

<h2>ACTIVITIES TO DO</h2>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Among Japan's top athletic pursuits is climbing Mount Fuji, situated 62 miles
 southwest of Tokyo. At 12,355 feet, it is the country's tallest mountain. As many
 as 400,000 people climb Mount Fuji every year during the climbing season, which 
 runs from July through Aug. 31. In addition, the coral reefs off Okinawa make the 
 island one of the world's best places for scuba diving. In the winter, the Japanese 
 Alps and the mountains of Tohoku and Hokkaido draw many skiers.</th>
